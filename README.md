# MqttAWSClient
creation of 2 MqttAWSClient, one for subscribing, the other one for publishing.

Remember to add the correct path of certificates!

How To Use My Files:

in order to use it, after changing the correct variables (i.e. certificate paths, endpoint, etc..)
you have to start the subscription client (it runs until you press Ctrl + C or Cmd + C) and meanwhile it's running, execute publish.py

This is only an example, if u stop and re-run the subscribe.py, you won't see the "old" datas
